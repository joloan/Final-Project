This is may help with the interpretation for the coefficients:
Both dependent/response variable and independent/predictor variable(s) are log-transformed. Interpret the coefficient as the percent increase in the dependent variable for every 1% increase in the independent variable. Example: the coefficient is 0.198. For every 1% increase in the independent variable, our dependent variable increases by about 0.20%. For x percent increase, calculate 1.x to the power of the coefficient, subtract 1, and multiply by 100. Example: For every 20% increase in the independent variable, our dependent variable increases by about (1.20 0.198 â€“ 1) * 100 = 3.7 percent.
